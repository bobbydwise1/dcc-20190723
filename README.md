####  _This problem was asked by Twitter._

_Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix._

_For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal]._

_Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries._
